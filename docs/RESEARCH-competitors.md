## 7. Gaps & Opportunities

### What's Missing in Current Landscape:

1. **Discord-style UX** - Most platforms are traditional web apps or forums. None have the real-time, channel-based feel of Discord.

2. **Broad biotech focus** - Existing BioDAOs are specialized (longevity, hair, brain). No general-purpose biochemistry platform.

3. **Maker/DIY community** - All platforms target academics/researchers. No focus on "How To Grow Almost Anything" style makers.

4. **Simple onboarding** - Most require understanding DAOs, tokens, wallets. High barrier to entry.

5. **Project-centric organization** - Existing platforms organize by proposal/grant. Not by persistent project communities.

6. **End-to-end journey** - Most handle funding OR collaboration OR commercialization. Not the full ideation → product → revenue cycle.

### Our Differentiation:

| Existing Solutions | Our Platform |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Forum-style governance | Discord-style real-time chat |
| Specialized focus areas | General biochemistry |
| Academic researchers | Makers + researchers + hobbyists |
| Complex DAO onboarding | Simple project creation |
| Proposal-centric | Project community-centric |
| Funding only | Full lifecycle support |
