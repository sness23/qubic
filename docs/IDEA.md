i want to have a project where we have something with different projects in biochemistry
and you can fund them and vote on them
and then get rewards when their products go to market

we were doing things with How To Grow Almost Anything and we all made cool projects
a lot were almost commercially viable

i want to have a platform where we can all suggest cool ideas and then people
can ask questions, we can get collaborators and make a cool document and then
do the science and make the product and sell it

its like discord style interface mainly

each project gets their own discord server

you can make your own

it has lots of information about the project

and you can fund it
